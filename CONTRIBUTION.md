## Creating Flutter UI Components

Step 1 : Navigate to [ui-components](https://github.com/Clueless-Community/flutter-ui-components/tree/master/lib/ui_components) folder and Create the file for the component ui.

Step 2 : Create all the examples of the components in separate files.

Step 3 : Create another file in the same folder to include all those components in the single file. This can be achieved using [Lists](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-core/List-class.html).

[For example: ](https://github.com/Clueless-Community/flutter-ui-components/tree/master/lib/ui_components/alerts) Here the 'alert1', 'alert2', 'alert3', 'alert4' are examples of the [Alert](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/AlertDialog-class.html) widget. 
The [alert.dart](https://github.com/Clueless-Community/flutter-ui-components/blob/master/lib/ui_components/alerts/alert.dart) file consist a List of widget type and includes the examples widgets.

Step 4 : Once you are done with designing ui screen. It's time to create it's card at home screen. Navigate to [widget_category](https://github.com/Clueless-Community/flutter-ui-components/blob/master/lib/data/widget_category.dart). Assign a value to the keys 'categoryName' and 'categoryScreen'.

Here, `categoryName` is the key for the title name of a card and `categoryScreen` is the key for the Screen name of the component you have added.

Step 5 : Test it one more time. `Happy Coding🤗.`

## Updating Flutter UI Components

Step 1 : Navigate to [ui-components](https://github.com/Clueless-Community/flutter-ui-components/tree/master/lib/ui_components) folder. Open the folder named as the component you wanna update.

Step 2 : Add/Update the example of the component in separate files.

Step 3 : Add your added/updated component in the List contained in the screen file.

[For example: ](https://github.com/Clueless-Community/flutter-ui-components/tree/master/lib/ui_components/alerts) Here the 'alert1', 'alert2', 'alert3', 'alert4' are examples of the [Alert](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/AlertDialog-class.html) widget. 
The [alert.dart](https://github.com/Clueless-Community/flutter-ui-components/blob/master/lib/ui_components/alerts/alert.dart) file consist a List of widget type and includes the examples widgets. Actually this file will act as the screen for the component examples.

Step 4 (`Optional`): Once you are done with designing ui screen. It's time to create it's card at home screen. Navigate to [widget_category](https://github.com/Clueless-Community/flutter-ui-components/blob/master/lib/data/widget_category.dart). Assign a value to the keys 'categoryName' and 'categoryScreen'.

Here, `categoryName` is the key for the title name of a card and `categoryScreen` is the key for the Screen name of the component you have added.

Step 5 : Test it one more time. `Happy Coding🤗.`

## Reporting Bugs 

It's always welcomed to report and fix the bugs. 

If you found any bug or the feature not working properly, you can create that issue and start working on it. We will merge your pull request if it will make improvement in the app.

## Developing for Flutter

If you would prefer to write code, you may wish to start with our list of [good first contributions]https://github.com/Clueless-Community/flutter-ui-components/issues

1. [Setting up your engine development environment](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Setting-up-the-Engine-development-environment),
   which describes the steps you need to configure your computer to
   work on Flutter's engine. If you only want to write code for the
   Flutter framework, you can skip this step. Flutter's engine mainly
   uses C++, Java, and Objective-C.

2. [Setting up your framework development environment]

   which describes the steps you need to configure your computer to
   work on Flutter's framework. Flutter's framework mainly uses Dart.

3. [Tree hygiene]
   which covers how to land a PR, how to do code review, how to
   handle breaking changes, how to handle regressions, and how to
   handle post-commit test failures.

4. [Our style guide]
   which includes advice for designing APIs for Flutter, and how to
   format code in the framework.
  
   which should be used when proposing a new technical design.  This is a good
   practice to do before coding more intricate changes.

## Social events in the contributor community

Finally, one area where you could have a lot of impact is in contributing to social interactions among the Flutter contributor community itself
